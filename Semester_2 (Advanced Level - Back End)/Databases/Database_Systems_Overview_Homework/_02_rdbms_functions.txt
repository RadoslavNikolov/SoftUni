A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a program that lets you create, update, 
and administer a relational database. Most commercial RDBMS's use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the database, 
although SQL was invented after the development of the relational model and is not necessary for its use.

The leading RDBMS products are Oracle, IBM's DB2 and Microsoft's SQL Server. 
Despite repeated challenges by competing technologies, as well as the claim by some experts that no current RDBMS 
has fully implemented relational principles, the majority of new corporate databases are still being created 
and managed with an RDBMS.

A relational DBMS is special system software that is used to manage the organization, storage, access, 
security and integrity of data.  This specialized software allows application systems to focus on the user interface, 
data validation and screen navigation.  When there is a need to add, modify, delete or display data, 
the application system simply makes a "call" to the RDBMS.
