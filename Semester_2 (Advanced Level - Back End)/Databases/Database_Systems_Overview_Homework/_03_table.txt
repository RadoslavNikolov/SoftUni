A table is a structure with a bunch of rows (aka "tuples"), each of which has the attributes defined by the schema. 
Tables might also have indexes on them to aid in looking up values on certain columns.


A relation schema is the logical definition of a table - it defines what the name of the table is, 
and what the name and type of each column is. It's like a plan or a blueprint. 
A database schema is the collection of relation schemas for a whole database.
 


In computer programming, a table is a data structure used to organize information, just as it is on paper. 
There are many different types of computer-related tables, which work in a number of different ways. 
The following are examples of the more common types.

1. In data processing, a table (also called an array) is a organized grouping of fields. 
Tables may store relatively permanent data, or may be frequently updated. 
For example, a table contained in a disk volume is updated when sectors are being written.

2. In a relational database, a table (sometimes called a file) organizes the information about a single topic into rows and columns. 
For example, a database for a business would typically contain a table for customer information, 
which would store customers' account numbers, addresses, phone numbers, and so on as a series of columns. 
Each single piece of data (such as the account number) is a field in the table. A column consists of all the entries in a single field,
such as the telephone numbers of all the customers. Fields, in turn, are organized as records, 
which are complete sets of information (such as the set of information about a particular customer), 
each of which comprises a row.
