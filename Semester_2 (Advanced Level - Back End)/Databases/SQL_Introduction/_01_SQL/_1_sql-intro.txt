Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard computer language for relational database management and data manipulation. 
SQL is used to query, insert, update and modify data. Most relational databases support SQL, which is an added benefit for database 
administrators (DBAs), as they are often required to support databases across several different platforms. 


SQL code is divided into four main categories: 
•Queries are performed using the ubiquitous yet familiar SELECT statement, which is further divided into clauses, including SELECT, 
FROM, WHERE and ORDER BY.


SELECT column_name, column_name
 FROM table_name
 ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC, column_name ASC|DESC;



•Data Manipulation Language (DML) is used to add, update or delete data and is actually a SELECT statement subset 
and is comprised of the INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE statements, as well as control statements, 
e.g., BEGIN TRANSACTION, SAVEPOINT, COMMIT and ROLLBACK.

INSERT INTO table_name (column1,column2,column3,...)
 VALUES (value1,value2,value3,...);

DELETE FROM table_name
 WHERE some_column=some_value; 

UPDATE table_name
 SET column1=value1,column2=value2,...
 WHERE some_column=some_value;

INSERT INTO table2
(column_name(s))
 SELECT column_name(s)
 FROM table1;


•Data Definition Language (DDL) is used for managing tables and index structures. 
Examples of DDL statements include CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE and DROP.

CREATE DATABASE dbname;

CREATE TABLE table_name
 (
column_name1 data_type(size),
column_name2 data_type(size),
column_name3 data_type(size),
 ....
 );

ALTER TABLE table_name
 ADD column_name datatype

ALTER TABLE table_name
 DROP COLUMN column_name


DROP TABLE table_name


•Data Control Language (DCL) is used to assign and revoke database rights and permissions. Its main statements are GRANT and REVOKE.
